Autogenerating CSS
########################

We use Compass to automatize and produce quality CSS

============
Requirements
============

* `Ruby <https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/>`_
* `Compass <http://compass-style.org/install/>`_

==========
Quickstart
==========

* Go to SASS repository folder ``source``
* Run ``compass watch``

Now everytime you make a change at the scss files a compressed version is going to be placed automatically at ``public`` folder.
